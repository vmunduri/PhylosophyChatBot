      "of phenomenology forms one basic field in philosophy among others. How is phenomenology distinguished from, and related to, other fields in philosophy?   Traditionally, philosophy includes at least four core fields or disciplines: ontology, epistemology, ethics, logic. Suppose phenomenology joins that list. Consider then these elementary definitions of field:   The domains of study in these five fields are clearly different, and they seem to call for different methods of study.   Philosophers have sometimes argued that one of these fields is “first philosophy”, the most fundamental discipline, on which all philosophy or all knowledge or wisdom rests. Historically (it may be argued), Socrates and Plato put ethics first, then Aristotle put metaphysics or ontology first, then Descartes put epistemology first, then Russell put logic first, and then Husserl (in his later transcendental phase) put phenomenology first.   Consider epistemology. As we saw, phenomenology helps to define the phenomena on which knowledge claims rest, according to modern epistemology. On the other hand, phenomenology itself claims to achieve knowledge about the nature of consciousness, a distinctive kind of first-person knowledge, through a form of intuition.   Consider logic. As we saw, logical theory of meaning led Husserl into the theory of intentionality, the heart of phenomenology. On one account, phenomenology explicates the intentional or semantic force of ideal meanings, and propositional\n",

      "in relative isolation from one another. It is time to emphasize the ‘relative’ qualifier. A common assumption of those who do philosophy in the West nowadays is that it had its roots in Greece. Park (2013), however, has argued that the more common view in the eighteenth century was that it began in India and/or Africa, which then passed it onto Greece. And as Van Norden (2017) points out, European philosophers who encountered Chinese thought in the 17th century immediately recognized it as philosophy. The Jesuits, who were deeply trained in philosophy, produced the first major translation of the Analects into a European language, and titled it Confucius Sinarum Philosophus (Confucius the Chinese Philosopher, 1687). Leibniz was greatly struck by the way the Book of Changes represents the structure of the world through a system of broken and unbroken lines, which he believed to bear uncanny resemblance to his invention of binary arithmetic, which was to become the digital language of computers.   Chinese and Western traditions may currently be undergoing an increased period of interaction and mutual influence. Wong (2009) develops a metaethical theory drawing from contemporary forms of philosophical naturalism, Hume, Mencius, and Xunzi. Stephen Angle (2012) defines two kinds of comparative philosophy: (a) “rooted global philosophy” is working within a particular live philosophical tradition in such a way as to be open to stimulus and insights from other philosophical\n",

      "Philosophy”. Like almost everywhere else in the world, the twentieth century in China was characterized by the incorporation of ideas from other cultures, most obviously from Europe. The terms “philosophy” and “metaphysics” were introduced as distinct concepts through translation and thus they become the objects of conscious reflection. Even scholars dedicated to “Chinese Philosophy” set themselves in dialogue with the West, so that almost all philosophy was more or less fusion philosophy. The main influences from Europe were Kant, Hegel, and Marx, but a wide range of philosophers were incorporated, including Nietzsche, Bergson, Dewey, and Heidegger. Almost all of the major philosophers in China—from Xiong Shili 熊十力 (1885–1968) to Feng Youlan 馮友蘭 (1895–1990) to Mou Zongsan 牟宗三 (1909–1995)—were concerned with establishing a metaphysical foundation for Chinese  Philosophy.[13]  These philosophers, drawing on resources from multiple cultures and traditions, are better suited for an entry on “Metaphysics” than one on “Metaphysics in Chinese Philosophy”.
